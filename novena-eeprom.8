.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Novena contains an onboard EEPROM that is used by the bootloader to determine
everything from available featurs to where the root filesystem is located.
You can use \fBnovena-eeprom\fR to view and modify this EEPROM data.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-m " mac-address"
MAC address for the gigabit ethernet port.  If set to the special value of
\fIff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\fR, then a new address will be "randomly" generated at
boot (when not much entropy is available.)
.TP
.BI \-s " serial-number"
32-bit device-specific serial number.  Assigned at the factory, but you can
change it if you really want to.
.TP
.BI \-f " feature-list"
Select a list of features installed on this Novena.  Currently-defined features
include:
.TS
allbox tab(^);
c s
c c
l l.
Available Features
Flag^Description
es8328^ES8328 audio codec
senoko^Senoko battery board
edp^eDP bridge chip (it6251)
pcie^PCIe Express
gbit^Gigabit Ethernet
hdmi^HDMI output
eepromoops^Log kernel panics to EEPROM
sataroot^Use SATA as root filesystem
.TE
.TP
.BI \-o " eepromoops-params"
Specify the eepromoops offset start, and optionally size.  If one number is
specified, this will set the eepromoops start, and the size will be unaffected.
If you specify two numbers (delimited in some fashion, e.g. 1-2 or 100,200 or
1000;2000), the second number will be set to the eepromoops length.
.TP
.BI \-p " eeprom-page-size"
The number of bytes that can be written at once to the EEPROM.  Refer to
the datasheet for this number.
.TP
.BI \-l " eeprom-length"
The length (in bytes) of the EEPROM.
.TP
.BI \-1 " LVDS channel 1 modeline"
.BI \-2 " LVDS channel 2 modeline"
.BI \-m " LVDS channel 2 modeline"
Specify modeline timings for the various output devices.  See \fBMODELINES\fR
below for more information.

If a channel is present, specify the \fIchannel_present\fR flag.  If you're
using a dual-lane LVDS device, specify \fIdual_channel\fR for LVDS channel 0.
.TP
.BI \-w
Write the specified values to the EEPROM.  Without this flag, no values
will be written.
.TP
.BI \-e " output-filename"
Export the current EEPROM to a file.  Useful for taking backups, and copying
files from one device to another.
.TP
.BI \-i " import-filename"
Import a file to the EEPROM.  Used to restore an EEPROM file to a device.  Note
that you can specify additional parameters to modify a file as it gets written
to the board.  For example, you can import an EEPROM and then specify a new
MAC address and serial number all in one step.

In order to actually write the data, you must specify \fB-w\fR.  Otherwise,
\fBnovena-eeprom\fR will simply display the contents of the file.
.TP
.BI \-h
Print out a help message.

.SH MODELINES

You can specify modelines for various display devices.  The entire line should
be quoted.  Standard X11 Modeline format is supported, but the flags are
nonstandard:
.TS
allbox tab(^);
c s
c c
l l.
Available Modeline Flags
Flag^Description
channel_present^This channel is present
dual_channel^Run LVDS in dual-channel
vsync_polarity^Positive VSync
hsync_polarity^Positive HSync
\+HSYNC^Alias for hsync_polarity
\+VSYNC^Alias for vsync_polarity
mapping_jeida^Use JEIDA mapping for LVDS
data_width_8bit^Use 8-bit data
ignore_settings^Attempt to auto-detect the mode
.TE

You may only run LVDS channel 1 in dual-channel mode.  In this case, you
should still specify that LVDS channel 2 is present.  Marking other devices
as \fIdual_channel\fR has no effect.

Negative HSync or VSync is specified by omitting the polarity flag, or
specifying either \fI\-HSYNC\fR or \fI\-VSYNC\fR.

If \fIdata_width_8bit\fR is omitted, then an LVDS channel will use 6-bit data,
and the HDMI channel will use 10-bit data.

The mapping is only valid for LVDS.  If \fImapping_jeida\fR is not specified,
then PSWG/SWPG data mapping will be used.

An example modeline is:

.B 'Modeline "lvds1" 148.500  1920 2068 2156 2200   1080 1116 1120 1125 +HSync +VSync channel_present dual_channel mapping_jeida data_width_8bit'
